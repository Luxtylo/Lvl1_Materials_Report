\section{Conclusion}
The stiffness of UHMWPE is one factor which draws hammock campers to it. The ultimate tensile strength only needs to be sufficiently high, but a low modulus can significantly affect how the hammock is hung.

This is because, when weight is placed on the hammock, a low modulus rope will stretch more than one with a higher modulus. The angle between the rope and the horizontal is affected by this---with enough extension of the rope it can completely change how comfortable the hammock is.

The high modulus of the fibres - \SIrange{109}{132}{\giga\pascal} \pcite{dyneema_factsheet} - used in ropes typically used by hammock campers (for example Kingfisher \SI{3}{\milli\metre} braided dyneema \pcite{3mm_dyneema}) combined with their low mass and bulk makes them ideal.

Estimating a usage of around \SI{8}{\metre} for a typical hammock user, and taking a weight for \SI{3}{\milli\metre} dyneema of \SI{5}{\gram\per\metre}, we find that the weight of a typical quantity of dyneema is \SI{40}{\gram}--a negligible value compared to the weight of the fabric of a hammock. Compared to the bulk of long webbing straps, that can make a huge difference when hiking.

Overall, the tensile properties of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene work together to make it the ideal material for hammock suspension when hiking.
